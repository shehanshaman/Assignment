+1, JAPAN FIRM PLANS TO SELL U.S. FARMLAND TO JAPANESE," MORIOKA, Japan, March 12 -"," A Japanese real estate company  said it will launch a campaign to sell land in U.S. Farming  areas to rich Japanese.  Higashi Nippon House said it would offer around 2,200 acres  of land in Illinois, California, Florida and Indiana from early  April to gauge response. It set up International Farm Corp of  America in Chicago last September to oversee the operation.  American farmers would continue as working tenants and part  of the profits from harvests of rice, corn, soybean and oranges  would go to the Japanese investors as rental.  Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials told Reuters sales  were limited to farmers to keep land in agricultural use.  ""Two years ago, I began to seek my own farmland in Japan,""  said Isao Nakamura, president of Higashi Nippon. ""However, sale  of Japanese farmland is strictly controlled by the government,  so I began to look for the land in the U.S to make my dream to  own farm land come true.""  Nakamura said hundreds of companies exist in the U.S. To  sell farmland to investors as more and more farmers face  difficulties due to the recession in U.S. Agriculture.  REUTER"

+1, USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT," WASHINGTON, March 9 -"," The Soviet Union will likely honor  its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four  mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department  official said.  ""They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no  reason now to think they won't this year,"" he told Reuters.  ""They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European  Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers  from all sources at this point,"" the official said in  explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports  estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.  This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when  analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for  the first time in 15 years.  A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern  over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S.  corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's  recent interest.  Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying  countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan,  and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the  official said.  ""The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists""  and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. ""As  soon as they need corn, they'll buy it,"" he added.  USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the  Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the  purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.  The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets  would enter the U.S. market again.  ""There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the  situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of  frenetic buying now,"" the official said.  However, the situation in wheat is ""a different story,"" he  said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase  commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet  purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.  Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.  is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to  the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation.    Reuter"

+1, INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM IDEAS," JAKARTA, June 18 -"," Indonesia rejected World Bank  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.  Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""  The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural  growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.  The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked  and the subsidies are a waste of money.  Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.  Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the  government would continue to maintain production targets for  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.  The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country  would save money by importing the commodity.  However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.  He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry  develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention  in the developed nations.""

-1, PERU PRESIDENT WARNS OF RETALIATION ON SILVER," LIMA, April 24 -"," The Peruvian government's freeze on silver  sales, which has contributed to a sharp boost in the metal's  price, could draw retaliation by rich nations and big traders  seeking lower prices, President Alan Garcia said.  Peru, the world's second biggest silver producer, stopped  selling its refined silver and state-marketed ore on tuesday.  Since then, the metal's price has risen to its highest level in  nearly three years. It closed today at over nine dlrs an ounce  on world markets.  Garcia said the move showed that a small nation like Peru  could move international markets and did not have to accept  cheap prices for silver, traditionally one of the top revenue  earners of the country.  Peru exported its refined silver last year at an average  price of 5.40 dlrs a troy ounce. As recently as one month ago,  silver bullion was trading for about 5.70 dlrs an ounce on  world markets.  ""One thing is that Peru, which produces silver, sells it  silently and in a submissive manner at the price world markets  want,"" he told reporters at the presidential palace.  ""The other is that a nationalist government says, 'wait a  moment I can't sell silver at these prices,'"" he added.  The peruvian energy and mines minister, Wilfredo Huayta,  said the government would maintain its freeze on new sales of  silver until the price of the metal reaches ""the true value this  raw material should have."" He did not specify this level.  Garcia said rich nations and big traders, faced with Peru's  stance, could try to defend themselves.  ""They have some stocks, they have silver deposits, they can  make fictitious sales and that way try to make the price of our  mineral fall in the world market,"" Garcia said.  ""Whatever manoeuvre they take will be answered by Peru,"" he  said. ""Peru is in a position of action.""  President Garcia had recently spoken by telephone with  Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid, Huayta said. Mexico is  the world's biggest producer of silver.  Mexico and Peru together produce nearly nearly 40 pct of  the world's silver, the official newspaper El Peruano said.  The newspaper added that Peruvian central bank president  Leonel Figueroa and the head of the central bank of Mexico,  Miguel Mancera Aguayo, met in Mexico City yesterday to  coordinate actions aimed at consolidating the upward trend of  the price of the metal.  Analysts in Zurich, a major silver trading centre, said  today the rally in silver prices was also fuelled by investors  buying the metal to protect themselves against inflation, which  they fear could be rekindled by the dollar's weakness.  On an historical basis, silver is still relatively cheap  compared to gold, which some investors believe could set the  stage for further rises, they said.  Reuter"

The 12 European Community (EC) countries have licensed a  total of 4.22 mln tonnes, while at the same year-earlier period  the EC contracted for 3.17 mln tonnes, they said.  The Netherlands is registering an increase in licences to  around 2.9 mln tonnes, up 400,000 tonnes from last year, they  said.  Total EC tapioca imports during the current agricultural  year are expected to stagnate at last year's level of around  6.0 mln tonnes, the sources said.  They reported a rise in consumption and in import licences  for France, Spain and Belgium but said the West German compound  feed industry was increasingly using grain in feed mixtures.  Sellers quoted tapioca for nearby delivery at around 27  marks per 100 kilos against 37 marks in March and 34 marks in  April last year.  Feed barley was quoted at about 42 marks per 100 kilos,  resulting in higher West German feed stuff prices, but demand  was seen as slack.

+1, SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID," COLOMBO, March 30 -"," Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries  for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the  country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.  Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid  needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.  The letter said the government had to step in ""to avert  serious economic hardship"" and because the Social Services  Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision  of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.  The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six  month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop  was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and  other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of  sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.  In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha  (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been ""almost completely  devastated,"" the letter said. Maha paddy output was now  estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally  expected.  There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high  forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate  rainfall within the next three to four weeks.  ""Should the present drought continue, however, production is  estimated at around 20 mln bushels,"" the letter added.  Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90  and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last  year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.  The letter said villagers in most seriously affected  districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because  subsidiary crops had also failed.  It said the government's current budget did not permit it  to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected.  ""Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity  prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue  to exert pressure on the expenditure side.""  The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per  month for each family, as well as handling, transport and  distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by  the government would not be possible without seriously  impairing development projects, or ""greatly fuelling inflation""  in the economy, the letter said.  The letter said the Food Department would be able to  release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the  immediate cereal requirements ""provided such stocks are replaced  subsequently.""  The Meteorological Department said the country was  experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month  dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when  the monsoon rains fell in late May.  The letter said some areas had been experiencing the  drought since August, and in the rice growing district of  Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June  1986.  Reuter"

The province produces 23 pct of Cuba's beef and is the  island's number two province in milk production. Granma said  20,000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger.  The newspaper said a ""cattle emergency"" had been decreed and  the cattle are being rounded up.  Some 110,000 head have been transferred to the sugar cane  conditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleaned  before being sent to the mills. The cattle are being fed the  residue left after cleaning the cane stalks. 32,000 head have  been sent to nearby provinces of Las Tunas and Ciego de Avila.  Despite Cuba's ambitous cattle development plans, beef  rationing has been in effect over the past 25 years. In Havana,  each Cuban receives approximately 3/4 lb of rationed beef every  18 days.  In a major area hit by drought, San Miguel, practically no  rain has fallen in the past 14 months.

-1, TAIWAN SEES SHARP DECLINE IN SHIPBREAKING," TAIPEI, April 1 -"," Taiwan's shipbreaking industry is  expected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986  because of keener competition from South Korea and China, the  rising Taiwan dollar and U.S. Import curbs on steel products,  industry sources said.  Last year, Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344  vessels totalling 3.69 million light displacement tons (ldt),  up on 165 of 2.97 million ldt in 1985, Lin Chung-jung, a Taiwan  Shipbreaking Industry Association (TSIA) spokesman, told  Reuters.  China scrapped vessels of some 1.1 mln ldt last year while  South Korea demolished ships of 910,000 ldt, he said.  Yao Liu, president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co, a leading  shipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung, told Reuters, ""We  expect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expected  decline in our steel product exports.""  Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline in  scrapping operations this year due to falling demand from the  U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel.  Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steel  product exports to the U.S. To 120,000 tonnes in the first half  of 1987 from about 260,000 tonnes in the first half of 1986, a  Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.  Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan's steel  exports are more expensive than South Korea's and China's.  The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct against  the U.S. Unit since September 1985 and some bankers and  economists said it could appreciate to 32 to the U.S. Dollar by  the end of the year from 34.23 today, Yao said.  In comparison, the won rose by about five pct and yuan  remained stable during the same period, he added.  ""We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland China  because foreign importers have switched their purchases,"" he  said.  Taiwan's steel exports to the U.S., Japan and Southeast  Asia slipped to 148,000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987  from about 220,000 tonnes a year earlier, the Taiwan Steel and  Iron Association official said.  He said he expected further declines in later months but  did not give figures.  REUTER"

The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are  cleared and supplies of beet build up again.  This is the first time in many years that a factory has  been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.  Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,  but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.  Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British  Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year  out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.  Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting  problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining  its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2  mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the  spokesman said.  British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.  The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,  is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories  normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the  campaign.  As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been  harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13  pct had been lifted.

+1, U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED," NEW YORK, Oct 20 -"," A voluntary compliance system for  monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed  skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and  trade sources.  ""Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and  importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of  the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it  became a matter of the trade monitoring each other,"" one  analyst said.  On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said  the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a  voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to  monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.  Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee  importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the  U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring  authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,  it will still be allowed entry.  While many believe producers will not seek to add to the  overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some  will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of  monitoring controls, trade sources said.  ""Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted  to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,"" a  U.S. Customs spokesman said.  ""Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when  its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand  Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to  destination),"" he said.  Many see it as a true test of whether producers and  importers will abide by the quota system.  ""It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the  quota agreement,"" said one major U.S. roaster.  ""Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did  not act as a gentleman,"" said another analyst adding, ""without  the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the  producers' hands.""  Some feel that importers will take advantage of the  voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,  in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.  Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member  countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely  labelled.  According to customs officials, several green coffee  importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee  fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,  forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy  beans.  ""If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for  one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of  their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by  circumventing the quota provisions,"" said Paine Webber analyst  Bernie Savaiko.  Still, others believe that producers will not be hard  pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in  the U.S. in the near term.  ""It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not  have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system  seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so  much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a  threat,"" one trader said.

+1, COLOMBIA'S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE," BOGOTA, March 12 -"," Colombia intends to improve the  marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on  setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar  Gaviria said.  Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export  registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock  New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.  ""In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the  reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that  will allow private exporters to participate more actively in  Colombia's coffee export policy,"" he said.  Traders said this means the export registration price will  change more often in a truer reflection of market trends.  Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market  factors since a return to a system of International Coffee  Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short  term.  ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock  over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February  1986.  Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer  from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices  with increased volume.  ""Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of  coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do  so without an agreement among producers,"" he said.  He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5  mln bags as mentioned in market circles, ""because the idea is  precisely not to disrupt the market.""  Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86  coffee year which ended last September 30.  Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the  national coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought to  adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.  ""There is great expectation in the world for the policies  that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to  emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the  immediate future,"" he told journalists.  Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export  policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.  Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when  problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks  have been resolved.  Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying  Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to  suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the  Brazilian stand was quite clear.  He said Brazil's current quota ""reflects the reality of the  market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,"" but  added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that  determined it.  Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure  of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among  dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers  would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,  which did not happen.

+1, COFFEE PRICES SET TO CONTINUE SLIDE - TRADERS," LONDON, April 2 -"," Coffee prices look set to continue  sliding in the near term, given the lack of progress towards a  new International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quota  accord, according to coffee traders and analysts.  Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lows  yesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, when  the lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmed  expectations that efforts to restore quotas would not be  revived at this stage, they said.  The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 cents  a lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years.  Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO's annual  September council session, and in the interim the Brazilian  frost season from June to August may prove the only bullish  factor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futures  bounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading  range around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the market  recovered from yesterday's ""confidence blip,"" one trader  commented.  But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lower  prices in the near future, one trade source said.  The market had become increasingly vulnerable to  yesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stg  second position trading range for 22 successive sessions, he  said.  Technically the market is more likely to decline further as  it absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the  1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a ""three figure mentality,"" and  speculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the  psychological 1,000 stg level, he added.  Some traders said today's upturn was in part due to  Brazil's opening last night of May green coffee export  registrations.  This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as  no surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and  light trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence.  However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test of  support at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the only  possible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach  of Brazil's frost season, they said.  Roasters are believed to be well covered, limiting  activities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally not  taking up producer offers, they added.  Central American producers have sold the bulk of their  current crops, but robusta producers in West Africa and  Indonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment,  and this could pressure prices further, traders said.  However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to be  bullish, advised caution. ""Everybody's bearish now, just as they  were bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg,"" he said.  Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expressed  doubts the price spiral would continue much below current  levels. ""One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers --  there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall.""  While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September  1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail  prices.  ""Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like that  at this stage,"" a General Foods spokesman said.  Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in  response to market weakness. At the beginning of March the  price of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65  stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue to  fall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added.  Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in  the near future.  ""The market seems to have established some equilibrium and  doesn't look set to go much lower,"" a Nestle spokesman  commented.  Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, which  fell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg per  kilo for medium quality, traders added.  Reuter"

It reported a  net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986,  compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.  The company said it had been able to cut its losses because  its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu  started in the second half of 1986.  Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition  by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their  restructuring into a gold loan.  A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in  October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of  275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.

I am Kuma Savimbi, the first son of Paul Edward SAVIMBI, the murdered rebel leader of the UNITA REBEL MOVEMENT OF ANGOLA. Prior to my father's death he entrusted the sum of Twenty Four Million United States Dollars (US$24M).

The money was gotten from the sale of diamonds my father sold to an Arms and Ammunitions firm in Russia. I saw that as a golden opportunity, since my father has been killed and is no more in command, which means the war will soon be over, so I decided to divert and convey this money to my own destination due to what is happening in my country where soldiers and Government functionaries are looting Government funds and properties. Following this political crisis, I was forced to leave our country to GHANA while my Mother and my brothers, sisters are now in Cote D'Ivoire. I am presently living in ACCRA-GHANA as an asylum seeker pending the outcome of application filed on my behalf by my attorney for travel documents in the Department of Home Affairs. According to the financial laws in GHANA, an asylum seeker does not have any financial right like opening of a bank account or making any large investment in the country. In view of this, coupled with the way in which the money was acquired, I decided not to invest this money in any African countries, and because of the involvement of GHANA in the peace process and also the involvement of the United Nations Peace Keeping Force in Angola makes me to have fear that if this money is invested in GHANA or any other African countries, I might loose it. Therefore, I am appealing and asking for your assistance in transferring this money for investment purpose either in your country or any other country outside Africa. I am prepared to offer 15% of the total sum to you for your effort and 85% will be for my family investment. I ask and appeal for is your complete assurance that this money will be safe with you as soon as it is transferred into your bank account or any account you wish this money to be transferred into outside Africa.

""We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we  still have some work to do,"" producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of  Ghana told Reuters after a producers' meeting.  European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers  accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted ""no  problems"" in getting full consumer acceptance.  Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement  today, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they  said.  The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from  non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer  stock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has  been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations.  The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier  proposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates  said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member  cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted.  Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of  price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into  the buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could  fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to  him.  The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between  the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move  some delegates described as ""just fiddling.""  But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease  some countries that were not satisfied with the original  proposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said.  The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any  day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or  forward positions, delegates said.  If the compromise is accepted by the council, most  consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect  next week, or as soon as practically possible.  The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to  discuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all  parties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meet  before the council.

+1, MALAYSIA DECLINES TO STATE POSITION ON COCOA PACT," KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 -"," Government officials in Malaysia, a  major cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will join  the International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stock  rules were agreed in London last week.  Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January  the cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but so  far a decision has not been announced. The government is said  to be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growers  and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because  certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage.  Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. The  government feels that the pact, through its buffer stock  mechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which is  labouring under surpluses, officials said.  But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia's  participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for  exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA.  They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at  current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it  because a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officially  estimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members.  Most growers and traders added they are also against a  buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires  withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump.  Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year,  might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30  mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and this  might affect their economic viability, they said.  ""The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it  will be a real messy business for the government and the trade  if it ever occurs,"" an industry source said.  The growers and traders also said that under new buffer  stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not  a member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is also  allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile.  Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such as  Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock.  Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to  join the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need  not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries  to join the agreement even at a later date.

+1, CUBA SUGAR CROP SEEN AT LEAST SAME AS LAST YEAR," LONDON, March 13 -"," Cuban sugar export figures for January  suggest that this year's crop may be at least as large as last  year's 7.35 mln tonnes, according to sugar analysts.  Exports in January totalled 733,000 tonnes raw value, up  from 725,000 a year earlier, according to figures received by  the International Sugar Organization.  January is the first major export month and the figures  thus give a good indication of the current crop, they said.  Fourth quarter exports fell to 622,000 tonnes from 909,000  tonnes a year earlier, but this was because Cuba was destocking  at the end of 1985, they added.  Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this  year at 7.50 mln tonnes.  Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was  12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln  tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes.  There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, but  a hurricane meant that last year's crop was extended.  Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at  362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comecon  countries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in the  same month last year, figures received by the ISO show.  Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all took  substantially more Cuban sugar.  Cuba's November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes,  compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and December's total was  237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before.

In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the  USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because  Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last  month.  USDA said the increased purchasing is ""somewhat surprising""  because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.  All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,  USDA said.

Licht said.  It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices  would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year,  Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was  probably minimal.  The total beet area in the European Community is forecast  to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986.  The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha,  against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at  4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln.  Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares  (with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114  (118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44),  Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138),  Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany  385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52),  Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136).

-1, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - MITSUBISHI HEAVY FIGHTS BACK," TOKYO, March 12 -"," International efforts to redirect Japan's  export-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy  going if the country's largest defence contractor and world's  biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by.  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd & lt;MITH.T > (MHI), which began  making ships and iron goods for Japan's military rulers 130  years ago, is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its  efforts to maintain its share of export markets.  ""If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products,  everyone will buy them,"" MHI president Yotaro Iida said.  Although two of MHI's main businesses, shipbuilding and  power plant construction, have been hit hard by the yen's 40  pct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans to  abandon them, Iida told Reuters in an interview.  Its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, has  performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money  Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year.  ""We have made the utmost efforts among the world's  manufacturers to improve productivity,"" he said. ""You may be  surprised if you come to see our plants. The outside is old but  the inside is ultra-modern, with robots and computers.""  Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that  MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors. The  company has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in  1976.  Despite its cost-cutting, MHI expects profits to drop 40  pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March  31, from 1985/86's record 50.14 billion.  And that includes gains from the sale of MHI's stake in  Mitsubishi Motors Corp & lt;MIMT.T > for 49 billion yen.  Iida is optimistic about the future, however. He said a  resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent  recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power  plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its  exports-to-sales ratio to the past decade's average of 30 pct.  MHI's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the  half-year ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five years  ago.  China is the most promising market, although MHI also  considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major  customers.  ""Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a  lack of foreign currency,"" Iida said. But he added that he felt  MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government  financial support.  It can also finance the plants itself and recover its  investment through product sales, a strategy Iida said could  prove popular in the future.  In shipping, MHI is fighting back against low-priced South  Korean competition by building more technologically advanced  carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products  difficult to transport.  Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the  world's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity.  Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects,  including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch  vehicles for man-made satellites.  It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence  Agency's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles, although all  of these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms.  MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to  develop the country's own fighter plane to replace the  currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s.  Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure  on Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas Corp  F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16, to reduce Japan's huge  trade surplus with the U.S.  ""It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S.  Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella,"" Iida  said.  MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic  Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in  the project when it moves from the research stage, he said.  The U.S. Has been seeking Japan's technological support.  In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI's  sales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. Iida said  the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and special  vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct.  As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shift  the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to  manufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined to  specify which products.  ""By the end of this year, you may find our brand name on  your daily products, although this does not mean we will run  away from our mainstream business,"" he said.  REUTER"

+1, U.S. FEEDGRAIN 0/92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION," WASHINGTON, March 6 -"," Advocates of a 0/92 plan for  feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a  disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is  scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional  sources said.  The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English  (D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to  implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.  An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987  wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that  scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.  Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,  it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should  be treated equally, they said.  If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then  supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not  offer their proposals next week, sources said.  English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles  Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but  whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.  Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first  choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat  farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid  for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of  controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an  even greater cutback in the bill, they said.  Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still  receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.  Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)  have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to  include a 0/92 program for feedgrains.  An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm  bill, but to be fair to all crops.  Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would  likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are  greater than to idle the land, economists said.  Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is  premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the  House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the  impacts of such a program.

+1, NEW ZEALAND MAY BUY U.S. WHEAT -- USDA," WASHINGTON, April 1 -"," New Zealand may need about 100,000  tonnes of wheat this year, which would normally come from  Australia, but may be from the United States, the U.S.  Agriculture Department said.  In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the  department said with the deregulation of the New Zealand Wheat  Board, which normally imports wheat from Australia, there is  the possibility of wheat purchases from the united states since  the shipping cost between New Zealand and the Eastern Coast of  Australia and the West Coast of the United States are about  equal.

-1, PERU SAYS IT HELD TALKS WITH MEXICO ON SILVER," LIMA, April 24 -"," The heads of the central banks of Mexico  and Peru have met in Mexico city to coordinate actions aimed at  consolidating the upward trend in the price of silver, the  official newspaper El Peruano said.  It said that Peruvian central bank president Leonel  Figueroa met yesterday with the president of the bank of  Mexico, Miguel Mancera Aguayo.  Peru, which froze new sales of refined silver and its  government-marketed silver ore on tuesday, is the world's  second biggest producer of the precious metal. Mexico is the  largest producer.  Together, the two nations account for nearly 40 pct of the  world's silver output, the official paper El Peruano said.  Peru adopted the move on tuesday in an bid to stablilise  the price of silver bullion, which has climbed in a month from  about 5.70 dlrs an ounce to over 9.00 dlrs an ounce today.  After the meeting of the Peruvian and Mexican central bank  heads, it was understood that Mexico might diversify the use of  silver, El Peruano said.  It said that Mexico and Peru did not want to speculate with  the price of silver. Instead, they aimed to see that the price  of the precious metal recuperated to adequate levels.  El peruano did not specify what these levels were.  El peruano quoted energy and mines minister Wilfredo Huayta  as saying that Peru did not want to participate in speculative  operations with silver.  He said the government's aim was to avoid a ""brutal fall"" in  the price of silver.  Figueroa's office confirmed the Peruvian central bank  president had travelled to mexico city. It was not certain if  he had returned to Lima by midday today.  Reuter"

+1, FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT," CHICAGO, Feb 26 -"," The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios  seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has  pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean  processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean  meal and oil.  The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the  National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78  mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over  the past two months when crush margins surged to the best  levels seen in over a year.  Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed  soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the  weekly crush number.  However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,  with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge  in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next  few months.  U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed  demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder  than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in  an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.  Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent  weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the  nearby March contract today.  ""Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold  May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,  which would cause March to gain on deferreds),"" one CBT crush  trader said.  ""But they've been bailing out this week because the March  has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not  tomorrow, then later in the month,"" he added.  As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush  ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)  fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per  bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two  days.  The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no  processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable  level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut  back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.  With futures down, processors are finding they must bid  premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.  A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents  for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down  sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below  the average cost of production, cash dealers said.  Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with  little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But  processors will start halting production in the next few weeks  it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.  Reuter"
-1, HOMESTAKE & lt;HM > MULLS BUYING ORE RESERVES," NEW YORK, April 13 -"," Homestake Mining Co is considering  acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's  exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger told Reuters  in an interview.  ""We are looking at more options to acquire more reserves  rather than just exploration,"" Conger said adding, ""the move to  consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's  acquisitions policy.""  Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120  mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,  Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which  have not been drawn on today and could be used to finance an  acquisition, he said.  Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be  about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said  exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than  last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas  exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6  pct.  Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about  the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.  However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin  reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400  ounces due to start-up production problems.  He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400  U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.  IN 1986, company earnings were based an average market  price for gold of 368 dlrs an ounce.  Conger said a three pct change in gold prices represents a  12 cts a share impact on earnings but he declined to give a  specific forecast for 1987's first quarter, due to be released  in 10 days, or for full year 1987 results.

+1, UGANDAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSES NEW TAXES," KAMPALA, April 24 -"," The Ugandan government, in its four  year investment and development plan, proposed taxing land and  food crops in an attempt to broaden its revenue base away from  dependence on coffee sales.  The government also said in the plan, made available to  Reuters, that a devaluation of the Ugandan shilling would do  little to redress a chronic balance of payments deficit.  The plan, the first since President Yoweri Museveni took  power 15 months ago, seeks to raise 2.4 billion dlrs in  investment funds from abroad between 1987 and 1991.  It says the government had already secured 1.4 billion dlrs  in pledges before Islamic lenders promised a further 494 mln  dlrs at a conference in Kampala last week.  Uganda already had an external debt of 984 mln dlrs at the  end of 1986 and in the nine months of the current budget debt  servicing will cost 204 mln dlrs, almost 50 pct of export  earnings of 431 mln, the plan said.  The new fiscal measures include a proposed tax on large  land holdings, regardless of whether the owners are exploiting  them, and taxes on maize, beans and other crops sold by the  Produce Marketing Board.  The plan says the aim is to spread the tax burden, which in  Uganda has traditionally fallen almost exclusively on coffee  farmers. Coffee provides over 90 pct of foreign exchange  earnings and more than 70 pct of government revenue.  On exchange rate policy, it repeats Museveni's argument  that any form of fotation would not help allocating resources.  Western governments and multilateral funds say the Ugandan  shilling is grossly overvalued and the government must change  the exchange rate if it wishes to encourage investment. The  shilling sells on the black market at more than 15,000 to the  dollar, compared with an official rate of 1,400.  REUTER"

-1," MEXICO SILVER POLICIES UNCHANGED, OFFICIALS SAY"," Mexico City, April 29 -"," Mexico's policies for silver  production and sales have not changed despite Peru's decision  last week to freeze its silver sales, government mining and  central bank officials said.  The officials also expressed doubt that such a policy  change was in the works.  Mexico is the world's leading silver producer and had an  output of about 73.9 mln troy ounces last year, according to  preliminary government figures.  Peru, the world's second leading silver producer, last week  suspended sales of the precious metal in what authorities in  Lima said was an effort to protect its price in an unstable  market.  Since the decision, Peruvian officials have said they will  discuss cooperation in the silver market with Mexican officials  in scheduled meetings.  Last week, Peruvian central bank president Leonel Figueroa  and the head of the central bank of Mexico, Miguel Mancera  Aguayo met in Mexico City in private talks said aimed at  consolidating the upward trend of silver prices.  Mexican minister of energy and mines, Alfredo del Mazo, is  also expected to meet so on with his Peruvian counterpart,  Wilfredo Huayta.  However, no Mexican decision has been made to follow the  Peruvian example of suspending new silver sales, Mexican  officials said.  One Mexican mining sector official working closely with the  government's production and sales policy told Reuters there  have been no changes in policy handed down by the central bank.  ""The same policy that has been followed will be continued,""  said the official, who asked not to be further identified.  A spokesman for the central bank said the bank had no  information on any silver policy changes.  An energy and mines ministry spokesman and an official in  the ministry's metallurgy department also said no government  silver policy change had been made.  The mining sector official also said he doubted Mexico  would follow Peru's policy, reasoning that if the two  governments had intended to coordinate silver policies, Mexico  would have announced a sales suspension along with Peru last  week.  ""It's very probable a change won't be made,"" the official  said.  Reuter"

-1, ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT," LUSAKA, June 18 -"," Zambia's copper mining industry is hoping  to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a  year in the next few years despite low world prices,  deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry  officials said.  But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough  International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has  introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure  the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.  Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia  Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year  ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a  record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.  ""We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial  year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due  to greater availability of spares and equipment,"" a ZCCM  official said.  ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another  strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.  Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes  higher than the previous year and the best production achieved  to date.  Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper  industry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining  is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the  country's foreign exchange earnings.  Production has also been seriously affected in recent years  by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of  spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output  last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.  A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984  by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African  Development Bank and the World Bank.  The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and  metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.  ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has  said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as  part of the plan.  More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the  industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under  the five-year restructuring plan.  Company officials said although reserves were being  depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the  end of the century, though at lower levels of production.  Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for  the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln  kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being  levied, a net loss is likely to be registered.  ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared  with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.  Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in  1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as  the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over  two to the dollar.  But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the  auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,  and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic  strategy based on national resources.  ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the  break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.  ""We are still consulting to see how the new measures will  affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare  under the new situation,"" Peter Hansen, director of operations  and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.  Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange  rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export  profits.  ""Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even  point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,"" Frederick  Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.  High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian  industry.  Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69  cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States  and under 40 cents in Chile.  The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia  being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had  stopped sBending copper south through South Africa.  Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are  sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while  5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.  Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and  fuel.  Reuter"

-1, MAJOR EUROPEAN ZINC SMELTER MERGER SEEN BY 1990," AMSTERDAM, June 16 -"," There should be at least one merger  between major European zinc smelters before the end of the  decade, Christian Bue, Executive Vice President (comme rcial) of  SMM Penarroya in France, said.  Speaking on the second day of the Metal Bulletin base  metals conference, Bue said he expected the current talks  between five smelters including Penarroya to result in  integration between at least some of the companies before 1990.  The five companies, SMM Penarroya, Outokumpu Oy, Preussag  Ag, Ste de la Vieille Montagne and Boliden Ore and Metals AB,  have 22 pct of the world market, Bue added.  ""We have no alternative than to integrate out businesses  into large trading blocs if we are to survive the cut-throat  price competition and the trend to forward integration from the  mining companies,"" Bue said.  ""It is by no means certain that all the five companies  involved in the talks will integrate together. It is quite  likely, and even preferable, that the European smelters form  two or three large integrated blocs.  ""In this way we will be better able to negotiate with our  concentrate suppliers on one side, and with the metal buyers on  the other,"" Bue added.  In the past, production overcapacity and the intense  competition between the European zinc smelters has meant they  have not only been in a very weak negotiating position when  buying concentrates, but in an even weaker one when selling the  metal, Bue noted.  Although the apparently easy solution is to simply shut  down excess capacity, the burden of this on individual  companies is far too heavy and no one can be expected to  volunteer, he added.  Another possible but very risky solution is to invest  heavily in more modern and lower cost facilities, he said.  ""My answer to this suggestion is that individual companies  who do not invest will surely die, and those that do invest  might survive, but only might, "" Bue said.  ""The only real option in my mind is integration,  rationalization and stabilization. We have no alternative, "" he  added.  Bue also said that the European smelters were completely  dissatisfied with the tradition of pricing concentrates and  metals in US dollars, and suggested moving either to a basket  of the world's major currencies or pricing in European currency  units (Ecus) to protect against exchange rate volatility.  Bue's views on integration between European smelters were  met by general approval from the conference audience comprising  representatives from many of the world's major mining, smelting  and trading companies, although some of the mining  representatives were somewhat sceptical in view of their own  industry's move towards integration with smelters.  However, some concentrate traders did express worry about  their own position if the metals industry does make the move to  large trading blocs.  The currency basket suggestion cropped up constantly, but  few said they thought matters would change in the near future.  REUTER"

The 56 were eventually brought  safely out of the mine.  Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could  take from a few days to several weeks, but would not be more  specific.  Noranda said that, when it resumes production, it plans to  operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 metric  tons annual finished capacity.  The fire weakened part of the mine's support structure,  Coffin said.  Noranda said if it decides to keep the mine open, it would  take four or five months before it could resume full  production.

+1, NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER," New York, April 1 -"," New York coffee futures prices will  probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a  consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts.  Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00  dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the  International Coffee Organization did not place new export  quota discussions on its current agenda.  Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five  years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February.  ""Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents,  perhaps 85 cents,"" said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with  Elders Futures. ""But the additional downside may not be all  that great from current levels.""  ""At this price level the market is very vulnerable to  bullish developments,"" O'Neill added. ""Rather than us having a  market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode --  probably to around 85 cents.""  ""I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief  drop to 85 cents,"" said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with  Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze  in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor,  with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time.  A trader at a major international trade house, who asked  not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but  believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high  export price and requires a high contribution quota from  exporters the market could steady at the lower levels.  Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on  Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new  international agreement could come into force next fall.  Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen  from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb  today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and  demand.  Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of  stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will  need to do some buying soon.  ""Most producing nations have just completed or are about to  complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at  their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and  warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly  overburdened,"" said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson  Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report.  Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to  service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell,  and ""this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to  undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows.""  Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before  Brazil's frost season begins in June.  Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by,  though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is  passed and demand usually slows this time of year.  Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of  January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags  compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown  for the usually busy winter roasting season.  But Elders O'Neill said, ""The roasters are not overstocked  by any means.""  Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult,  given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory  below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several  traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short  term.

""The Libyan b ombing is a thing of the past, the trade war  didn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation  on terrorism,"" one U.S. Official told Reuters.  ""It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect,  more harmonious than usual.""  Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to  deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the  United States.  During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in  Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.  Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a  circuitous route. That angered Washington.  The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a  year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong  enough action against terrorism. ""Now they are. We're pleased  and they are pleased that we are pleased,"" one said.  More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain  markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European  Community  threatened to become a trade war.  In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate  Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was  poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food  imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.  Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,  supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a  major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases  in northern Chad.  A French official added: ""There is also a common interest in  getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the  world by opening up its markets.""  Although relations have improved markedly between the two  countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the  Community's common agricultural policy (CAP).

+1, ICO COFFEE PRODUCERS TO DISCUSS MARKET SITUATION," LONDON, April 1 -"," International Coffee Organization, ICO,  producers will meet at 1500 GMT (0900 est) for a general  discussion of the market situation, producer spokesman  Lindenberg Sette said.  The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the  meeting but Brazil was not among them. The ICO executive  board's regular session this week has so far been confined to  routine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to  revive export quota negotiations, delegates said.  Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when  producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how  quotas should be allocated.  Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency among  producers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with most  countries now prepared to wait for the ICO's annual September  council session to restart negotiations.  Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called for  today's producer meeting to exchange views on the market  situation, the producer delegates said.  The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this week  was cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee prices  in London and New York futures, traders said.  Near May in London hit a five-year low this morning at  1,220 stg, about 50 stg below last night's close, they said.  The executive board session looks set to end today,  following a final session at 1600 GMT (1000 est) when a  consultancy report of the operation of the ICO will be  presented to producers and consumers, delegates added.

-1, PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING," TOKYO, April 1 -"," A proposed sales tax on gold transactions  could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of  trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and  Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press  conference.  ""If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,  Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,""  he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would  be unable to compete in the international market, he added.  ""How can the government really raise taxes if the system  they impose is prohibitive of generating business?"" he said.  The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades  exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen  tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.  The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading  more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,  gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as  that of jewellery and coins, dealers said.  However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and  coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.  Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold  turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.  A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early  1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks  fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.  Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the  volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.  While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the  volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London  and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.  Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average  just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.  Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the  government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to  commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers  said.  Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese  trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign  participant.  Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one  and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while  futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers  said.  ""All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo  market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three  major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal  opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper  on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,""  Hofer said.  ""I don't think it fits the philosophy of an  internationalising market,"" he added.  Officials of several major Japanese trading houses,  attending the press conference, said they supported Credit  Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax.  REUTER"

+1, LYNG WARNS U.S. TRADE SITUATION IS EXPLOSIVE (RPT)," TOKYO, April 21 -"," U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng  said Japanese government officials do not seem to understand  that protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Could lead to an  explosive situation and protectionist legislation.  Speaking to the National Press Club of Japan, Lyng said  protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Has increased alarmingly  during the last six months.  ""It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive.  We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatory  laws which would have very serious consequences for other  countries, especially Japan,"" Lyng told reporters.  Lyng's comments about protectionist trade legislation  appeared to be a reference to the so-called Gephardt provision,  requiring retaliation against countries which have trade  surpluses with the U.S., Trade analysts said.  U.S. House majority leader Thomas Foley, a Washington  Democrat, yesterday predicted during a visit here that the  Gephardt provision will be approved by the House when trade  legislation is taken up later this month.  Senior Japanese officials do not seem to perceive the  volatility of the situation in the U.S., Where Congress is  increasingly unpredictable, he said.  ""The purpose of this trip is to emphasise the fact that  patience is beginning to be very much frayed in Washington. I  cannot emphasise that enough,"" Lyng said.  In talks with Japanese Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato  yesterday, Lyng and Trade representative Clayton Yeutter asked  Japan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end import  quotas on beef and citrus.  Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the U.S.  Request but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist response  in Congress, where legislation on rice retaliation has been  introduced in both the House and Senate.  Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market for  exports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farm  products since 1964, especially grains.  He said the U.S. Understands Japan, with a limited land  area, is concerned about maintaining some level of  self-sufficiency in food for national security reasons.  But he argued the freeing of farm product imports would not  necessarily weaken Japanese agriculture.  Lyng pledged the U.S. Will never again embargo shipments of  farm products as it did in 1973.

+1, SUGAR MARKET SEES GOOD RECENT OFFTAKE," LONDON, March 27 -"," Reports the Soviet Union has lately  extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight  raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under  New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for  sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said.  The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India,  Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China.  Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in  current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which  previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added.  Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet  Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling  Thai origin sugar.  Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened  considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly  for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block  enquiries by China, they said.  Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to  around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts  previously, they added.  Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more  sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement  this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some  1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said.  Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000  tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of  two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost  and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer  this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an  undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around  229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added.  Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer  physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged  recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders  said.  Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of  whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled  for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later.  Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white  sugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender  for 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for  arrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August.

-1, LITTLE REACTION TO COMEX PRICE LIMIT REMOVAL," New York, June 1 -"," The elimination of price limits on  precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in  New York appears to be having little effect on the market,  analysts said.  ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said William  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.  ""The market has not approached the old price limits and trading  is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he added.  Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on  market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker  in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.  On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two  contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver  futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.  During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and  down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to  rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts  said.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was much  confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.  The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms  a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades  in a timely manner.

It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue  underground development and obtain operating permits and  another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete  underground development, construct a mill and provide the  infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial  production.  St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were  granted in time, it would start gold production in the second  half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of  about 40,000 troy ounces.

-1, PLATINUM DEMAND ESTIMATED 17 PCT HIGHER BY 1991," LONDON, June 19 -"," Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mln  ounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln  in 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for Johnson  Matthey Plc said.  Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation  in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in  consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest  single application for platinum.  Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,  Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released  in London today.  Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further  increase in investment buying and may well be cautious.  He said South Africa was the most likely source of  additional supplies and will need to increase output by about  500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.  The capital investment required to produce the additional  output would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political  climate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.  The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the  1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,  Clark said.  ""The very probability of a growth in demand set against the  massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion  only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to  conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially  underpinned in the medium to long-term,"" Clark said.

-1, SWEDEN'S BOLIDEN TO OPEN SAUDI ARABIAN GOLD MINE," STOCKHOLM, Oct 19 -"," Mining group Boliden AB said it had  agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral  Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to  exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.  Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish  group would  be responsible for the technical side of the  operation and would have no control over the product itself.  He said one option under discussion for refining the gold  ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in  northern Sweden.  Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it  was strategically important since it increased Boliden's  presence in Saudi Arabia.  ""Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar  already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the  future,"" he said.  The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab  in the west of the country and should open in the first half of  1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold  smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.  Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi  Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to  open in modern times.

+1, COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE," LONDON, April 7 -"," The International Cocoa Organization  (ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the  downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying  operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.  Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could  reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices  significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging  the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the  ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special  Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 ""must buy"" level.  Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last  month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer  stock manager has completed preparations, traders said.  Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer  stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used  to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average  above the 1,600 SDR ""must buy"" level.  The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of  the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New  York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per  tonne yesterday.  Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and  September, but these are set to change to July, September and  December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot  month, traders noted.  The introduction of December into the calculations may lift  the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75  stg above May on the London terminal market.  But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the  higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the  indicator which governs his activities, traders said.  ""The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the  implications of delaying until forward prices lift the  indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,"" an  analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.  Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000  tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach  this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an  ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market  watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent  forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln  to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to  three mln.  A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87  world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared  with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of  94,000 tonnes, traders said.  In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to  buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the  ""must buy"" level.  But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put  constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock  manager can remove cocoa from the market.  The buffer stock system of price differentials set  according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from  non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action,  dealers said.  Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is  nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.  But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as  Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa  can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer  stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.  Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member  cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are  pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.  Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from  quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact  on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for  this cocoa over futures.  Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg  from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer  stock buying, dealers said.  ""The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will  provide a backstop for quality cocoas,"" one trader said.  Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer  stock were ""all prognostication"" and that no one could hope to  predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically  buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer  stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the  previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers  expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.  In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding  scheme as an additional market support mechanism.  REUTER"
+1, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND," FENGBANG COUNTY, China, April 1 -"," ""If we go on using up  farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in  20 years to grow grain on.""  Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on  the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it  tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same  time let them get richer by building factories and new homes.  China has to feed one quarter of the world's population,  but only one seventh of its land is arable.  Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into  a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in  1986.  But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which  has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for  factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.  Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of  its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller  amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during  the two years.  ""We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the  industrialisation began,"" official Xu said. ""Since then, nearly  all the families in the county have built new homes and many  factories have gone up.""  ""Last year we lost land to a new railway line,"" Xu said. But  land losses in future should fall because nearly all families  already have new houses, she added.  The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the  Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that  China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land  for the first time this year.  ""The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,  wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,"" said  an article in the official press explaining the new measures.  ""It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,"" it  said. ""China has a large population and its land resources are  badly deficient.""  An official of the Shanghai city government said county  authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of  arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must  be approved by the city government.  The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its  efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The  prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making  it more profitable for them to grow other crops.  To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser  and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to  buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to  China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise  grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.  Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the  problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.  Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the  eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too  much to the demands of ""selfish city people"" and could raise city  grain prices without any problem.  But the government has ruled out a price rise. ""Raising the  price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social  stability,"" said a China Daily editorial this month.  The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the  long term. ""We must be very careful. We have a very large  population which is used to price stability and will object to  price rises,"" he said. ""The problem is how to do it.""  The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might  also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with  grain and consumed by city residents.  In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate  investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.  The official press has reported that farmers fear farm  policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into  building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.  Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign  contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,  but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.  ""As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at  the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the  future,"" the China Daily said in an editorial last month.  Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to  use the land but not own it. For most of the period of  Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where  there was little room for individual initiative.  ""New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency  of government policies and make them interested in long-term  investment,"" the newspaper said.  REUTER"

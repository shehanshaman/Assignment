Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic  Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister  Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help  Japan as well as the United States.  The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by  Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.  However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was  already the world's largest grain importer.  Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and  depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food  requirements in 1985.  Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm  products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on  beef, citrus products and rice.  Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of  self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice  because potential production is higher than domestic demand.  The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of  rising production by exporting countries, he added.  Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product  output with expensive programs, Maki said.  Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions  on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks  at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative  Clayton Yeutter will join.

Noranda spokesman Denis Morin said it was impossible to  judge how long the shutdown might last but said he thought it  could be at least one week.  The mine produced 1,792,000 tonnes of ore in 1986, Morin  said. It has a mineral inventory of 35,065,000 tonnes.  In the mine's three zones last year, copper grade was 1.10  pct at Needle Mountain, 0.30 pct at Copper Mountain Oxide and  1.32 pct at Murdochville, Morin said.  Another Noranda spokesman said the smelter at Murdochville,  which has not been shut down, has the capacity to treat 218,000  tonnes of mineral concentrate per year.  The smelter treats ore from other mines as well as product  from the Murdochville facility, he said.

      "-1  PERU TO MAINTAIN SILVER SALES FREEZE\t LIMA, April 24 -\t Energy and mines minister, Wilfredo  Huayta, said Peru would maintain its freeze on new sales of  silver until the price of the precious metal reaches \"the true  value this raw material should have.\"  He spoke to reporters at the presidential palace after  meeting president Alan Garcia, whom he said recently spoke by  telephone with Mexican president Miguel de la Madrid. Mexico  and Peru are the world's two largest silver producers.  Huayta, asked what the true price level of silver should  be, repled: \"well, this cannot be predicted.\"  He said Minero Peru Comercial (Minpeco), the government's  minerals marketing arm, would closely study the price of silver  in the world market.  Last Tuesday, the government instructed Minpeco, which  handles all Peru's exports of refined silver and state-  produced ore, to immediately freeze all new silver sales until  the metal's price reached equilibrium in the world market.  Peru plans to produce 63 mln ounces of silver this year, and  is the largest producer of the precious metal after Mexico.  Huayta said both nations' central banks would coordinate  their work, but did not elaborate how they would do this.  Peruvian central bank president Leonel Figueroa and the head  of Bank of Mexico, Miguel Mancera Aguayo, met in Mexico City  yesterday to coordinate actions aimed at consolidating the  upward trend in the price of silver, the official newspaper El  Peruano said today.  Huayta said his Mexican counterpart, minister of oil, mines  and parastatal industry, Alfredo del Mazo, should be in Lima on  a visit at a nearby date.  Huayta added Peru did not want to see great fluctuations in  the price of silver, but declined to comment on what Peru would  like to see as a ceiling for the precious metal's price.

      "-1  TALKING POINT/GOLD\t Toronto, March 27 -\t The price of gold bullion and share  prices of North American gold stocks are benefiting from  continued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said.  \"There's been a tug of war between the (currency)  speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it  looks like the game has gone to the speculators,\" said John Ing  at Maison Placements Canada Inc.  The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today  against the Japanese yen despite buying by several central  banks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said.  A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the  traditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted.  Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd,  noted that \"a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars.  If they see they are losing money, they move back into gold.\"  A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ing  said, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a  four pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct.  Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its  current level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees an  average price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, Michael  Pickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs,  with a possible spike above 500 dlrs.  However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far  faster in recent months than the price of the metal itself,  causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere  in the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no sign  the buying pressure is slowing down. \"The stocks have run an  incredible way,\" Cohen said.  On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd & lt;ASA > rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2,  Campbell Red Lake Mines & lt;CRK > was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold  & lt;NGC > increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4.  The Toronto Stock Exchange gold index today was up 268  points at 8067.90. Hemlo Gold gained 1-1/4 at 26-3/4, LAC  Minerals was up 1-5/8 at 41, Placer Development rose 1-1/4 at  43-3/8 and Lacana Mining gained 1 at 18.  Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pct  since December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion has  increased six pct. \"Canadian golds have been the top performing  index this year,\" he noted.  In the U.S., there is \"too much money chasing too few  stocks,\" Pickens said. And many investing institutions such as  pension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash,  he added.  Cohen also noted that today's silver price break through  six dlrs an ounce indicates small investors are entering the  precious metals market and he expects the ratio between gold  and silver prices to narrow.

It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in  eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant  diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing  areas, it said.  The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and  other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than  seven months.  The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of  water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March,  lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric  power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and  consumers.  The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels  in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making  harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said.

      "1  US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT\t WASHINGTON, Oct 19 -\t A proposal to require imported  tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow  and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.  The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a  10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes  the plan would be adopted this year.  A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.  Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an  amendment to a farm spending reduction package.  \"I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving  American consumers the information they need,\" he said.  Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean  As sociation, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils  are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.  The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating  tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage  consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,  Indonesia and the Philippines.  But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal  \"blatantly discriminates\" against imports, would be impossible to  defend under international trade law and would harm relations  with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.  Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their  saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively  little from tropical oils.  The committee voted largely along party lines, with three  Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.  Reuter \n",

      "-1  LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS\t New York, June 1 -\t The elimination of limits on daily price  fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the  Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect  on the market, analysts said.  \"There is nothing apparent from the change,\" said William  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.  \"The market has not approached the old price limits and  trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,\" he said.  On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two  contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper  and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,  which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver  futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting  of all daily limits, effective today.  Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per  ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the  nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.  Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back  months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby  contracts amid quiet trading today.  During the last week of April, silver futures often traded  at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the  dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or  unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.  As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many  unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.  The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs  for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.  Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic  buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.  O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would  add caution to trading.  \"This is a more realistic approach because the metals  market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,\"  O'Neill said.

      "-1  ZINC CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTFALL SEEN IN 1988\t AMSTERDAM, June 16 -\t Next year is likely to see a shortfall  in zinc concentrates of up to 100,000 tonnes, although there  should be ample supply in 1987, Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltd  metals analyst Stephen Briggs said.  Speaking on the second day of Metal Bulletin's base metals  conference, Briggs said the major factor in his predicted  100,000 tonne shortfall in zinc concentrate supply in 1988 was  the imminent cessation of new mining and termination of milling  at Pine Point in Canada.  However, this could be partially offset by some stockpiles.  Nevertheless, despite this predicted shortfall there was  unlikely to be any dramatic change in treatment charges in  1988. The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one of  record production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipated  in Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacity  in South Korea.  \"Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are also  expected in 1987,\" Briggs said.  This would partly be due to a return to more normal levels  at existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied with  achievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faro  in Canada.  Looking further forward, the major event was the probable  opening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacity  of 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year.  \"Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that there  will be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s,\" he  added.  The picture for lead was also closely allied to that of  zinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and therefore  supply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products from  zinc mines.  \"On this basis, our calculations point to a modest  oversupply of lead concentrates in 1987,\" Briggs said.  The copper forecast, however, was for a record  non-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987,  increasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988.  Production of primary refined copper metal would also  increase, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading to  a moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnes  this year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of the  decade, he said.

      "1  PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES\t MANILA, March 27 -\t Philippine sugar production in the  1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,  up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar  Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.  Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling  season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate  would almost certainly be met.  He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would  be earmarked for domestic consumption.  Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the  U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and  50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.  He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA  recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take  up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.  \"The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying  approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by  July,\" Yulo said.  Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil  import bill by about 300 mln pesos.  Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to  start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.  The ethanol project would result in employment for about  100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by  depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.  Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had  been submitted to President Corazon Aquino.  \"I think the President would rather wait till the new  Congress convenes after the May elections,\" he said. \"But there  is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing  just slightly over our own consumption level.\"  \"The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,\" Yulo  said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos  per picul, up from 190 pesos last August.  Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation  following the SRA's bid to control production.  \"We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,\"  he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from  their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and  cloth production.  He said diversification into products other than ethanol  was also possible within the sugar industry.  \"The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,\" Yulo said.  \"They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they  relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to  call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry.\"  He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used  for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.  \"When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce  sugar,\" he said.  Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the  International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.  \"As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new  agreement which would revive world prices,\" Yulo said.  \"If there is no agreement world prices will always be  depressed, particularly because the European Community is  subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.\"  He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60  cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where  production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.  \"If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I  expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end  of this year,\" he said.  Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by  1990, with world consumption outstripping production.  He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments  from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.  \"But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,\" he  said. \"Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the  U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut  ours in half without any justification.\"  Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut  domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.  The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its  12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to  143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.  Yulo said despite next year's increased production target,  some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.  \"At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the  1986/87 season,\" he said. \"We expect two or three more to follow  suit during the next season.\"  REUTER \n",

      "1  CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS\t CHICAGO, March 3 -\t Chicago Board of trade grain traders and  analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to  handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new  crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans  in the futures markets.  Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will  be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because  corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives  deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.  Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they  sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.  With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,  traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing  rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop  soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more  attractive under normal circumstances.  An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the  limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,  means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln  more oat acres this year than last without being penalized,  traders said.  Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of  shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the  more attractive deal from the government, they added.  Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six  months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to  put soybean land back into cotton.  One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean  production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in  traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,  which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

The three locals cover about 2,600 production and  maintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley,  B.C. lead-zinc mine.  Output at both sites has been shut down since the  production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office  and technical workers, went on strike May 9.  The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and  technical workers have not negotiated since May 21.

The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,  produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of  lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles  east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,  most for processing at the Trail smelter.  The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.  Revenues from the Trail smelter totalled 356 mln Canadian  dlrs in 1986.  Reuter \n",

      "1  GATT OFFICIAL MEETS WITH U.S. FARM LEADERS\t WASHINGTON, April 8 -\t The official in charge of  agricultural matters in the new round of global trade talks is  in Washington today and tomorrow to meet with congressional and  Reagan administration officials.  Aart de Zeeuw, chairman of the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade's negotiating group on agriculture, met this morning  with members of the House Agriculture Committee.  Committee sources said De Zeeuw expressed concern over  protectionism and high farm price supports. House lawmakers  noted that in 1985 the United States took steps to reduce loan  rates, committee staff said.  \"Members told him (De Zeeuw) that we lowered our (U.S.) loan  rates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally,\" one source  said.  De Zeeuw was told of the U.S. lawmakers' frustration with  Japan's restrictive rice import policy, and members defended  the U.S. dairy policy, which aims to cut surplus production by  subsidizing producers to trim herds, sources said.  Later today De Zeeuw will meet the Senate Agriculture  members and Undersecretary of State Affairs Allen Wallis.  Tomorrow, De Zeeuw is to meet the House Ways and Means  Trade Subcommittee and the Senate Finance Committee, before  visiting Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.  De Zeeuw goes to Canada later this week. His trip to North  America is part of his attempt to meet farm policy leaders in  the key GATT member states.  The negotiating group on agriculture held its first meeting  in February and is expected to meet again in May.  Reuter \n",

      "-1  VESSEL LOST IN PACIFIC WAS CARRYING LEAD\t LONDON, June 18 -\t The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier  Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was  carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,  a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.  He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.  Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said  the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South  Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.  Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning  trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental  news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low  stocks.  Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates  could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this  depended on the quality of the concentrates.  A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply  pipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Supplies  there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at  one major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being  held at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining and  Smelting Ltd.

Consumer delegates said Bra Kanon had not formally  presented the compromise plan to producers and consumers, and  it was unlikely he would do so before Friday, they said.  There was widespread confidence a result on the outstanding  items could be reached by Friday, when the council session is  due to end, consumers said.  Bra Kanon completed bilateral consultations with several  delegations today on the main sticking points in the draft  buffer stock rules package, they said.  Certain delegations wanted further discussion on the amount  of non-member cocoa the buffer stock will be permitted to buy,  differentials for different origin cocoas and limits on buffer  stock purchases of nearby, and forward material, the delegates  said.  The buffer stock working group finalized the remaining  buffer stock rules, with only minor modifications to the  original draft buffer stock package produced last week, the  delegates said.  The ICCO council is due to elect a new executive director  when it reconvenes Friday, producer delegates said.  Producers intend to present a single candidate for the  post, and this is most likely to be Edouard Kouame from Ivory  Coast, they said.  Earlier, the existing executive director, Kobena Erbynn  from Ghana, was expected to re-nominated, but he is now likely  to withdraw, the delegates said.

The union's sugar beet committee met yesterday to consider  the implications of a government Monopolies and Merger  Commission, MMC, report issued last week. \"We are still  concerned about S and W Berisford being long-term owners of  British Sugar,\" a spokesman said. \"We do not view Berisford as  providing the long-term stability we want.\"  The Trade and Industry Secretary accepted a recommendation  last week by the MMC that it block a bid by Tate and Lyle for S  and W Berisford Plc and stop Gruppo Ferruzzi buying a majority  of British Sugar, owned by Berisford.

      "1  IBC EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN COFFEE EXPORT FORMULA\t RIO DE JANEIRO, March 30 -\t The Brazilian Coffee Institute,  IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when  it reopens export registrations, probably later this week,  exporters said.  They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leave  the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged  but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the  effects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations were  closed in mid-February.  To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to  be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed.  However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution  quota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets,  and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, the  exporters said.  They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution  quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet  funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed  producer price.  Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more  funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last  week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval.  The sources said it is still unclear when registrations  will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of  this week.  \"Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions  know. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanently  closed down,\" one exporter said.  However, before announcing its export policy the IBC is  likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the  International Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board in  London decides to call a full council meeting to discuss  reintroduction of export quotas, sources said.  There is also talk of the announcement this week of new  measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be  awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters  said.  Another factor which could be delaying the opening of  registrations is the current strike by bank workers which,  while not affecting current shipments, could affect  documentation and currency operations for new sales.  This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering  obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or  three days of registering a sale. \n",

      "1  INDONESIA PRESSING FOR COMPROMISE OVER COFFEE\t JAKARTA, March 12 -\t Indonesian coffee exporters are  preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their  government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of  export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian  Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters.  Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia,  the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and  improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas.  \"But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we  can never bridge the gap,\" Dharyono said.  Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries,  along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,  Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a  new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee  Organistion (ICO) talks in London.  Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the  Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal.  AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts  with Brazil to suggest a compromise.  Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO  negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight  were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest  producer, but gave no details.  \"Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a  compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market  stays like it is,\" Muda said.  He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the  U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of  an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1.  Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S.  And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press  them to present Indonesia's case more firmly.  He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the  country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations.  Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with  the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing  quotas on what he termed \"realistic criteria.\"  The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which  gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not  reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends.  Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old  system be applied.  Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market  prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop.  Although prices have long since come down to a point where  export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers  at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new  guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both  refusing to alter their positions.  Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed  Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices.  Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the  AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said.  Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30,  is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level  of 360,000 tonnes, he said.  He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for  the time of year.  REUTER \n",

      "1  FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE\t PARIS, June 1 -\t The U.S. Department of Agriculture's  forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will  almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be  surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.  The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'  Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal  Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or  end-of-season stocks.  However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end  1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln  was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.  The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast  in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for  soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and  the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.  This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around  31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of  Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares  against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.  ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign  will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC  official said.  Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to  estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and  to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.  He said, however, that among countries to which France  could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb  countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.  The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in  1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,  was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize  Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.  Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were  expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.  It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,  down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.  Reuter \n",

      "-1  LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS\t LONDON, April 9 -\t Lead prices have risen this week against  a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders  said.  Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying  or if labour problems develop in North America, they added.  London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at  a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and  prices tending to drift lower.  This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low  level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical  demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.  The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be  felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,  stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders  said.  The lower supply levels result from a number of different  factors around the globe.  Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries  because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish  exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at  Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant  additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have  been drawing on LME stocks.  In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,  South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks  for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet  commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.  And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes  per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks  and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the  U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and  a regular supplier to the world market.  Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,  have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.  On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up  quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported  in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the  first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying  order was filled by merchants in March.  Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices  this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and  establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months  delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in  Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often  a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.  On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp  and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,  and this is believed to be in strong hands.  Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest  level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses  which are not popular with merchants putting together  shipments.  But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since  the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to  secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies  affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on  the transport of used batteries.  Labour negotiations in North America will play an important  part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts  expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,  Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.  Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract  expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of  strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.  Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting  speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current  firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium  to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at  midsession.  Reuter \n",

      "1  VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS\t EDMONTON, Alberta, March 11 -\t Lower production of coconut  and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks  this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds  analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.  Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta  Agriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the world  vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.  \"Prices for edi ble oils appear to have more upside  potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented  decline in the production of tree oils,\" Balletto said.  Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm  kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln  tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.  He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at  33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance  at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.  Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said,  disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by  600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.  \"If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the  crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in  the edible oils sector could develop,\" he said.  \"This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high  oil yielding seeds,\" Balletto said.  Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices  because of burdensome supplies, he said.  World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase  for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes,  compared with 25.4 mln last year.  The increase should result from lower disappearance, as  production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7  mln last year, he said.  World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln  tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said,  while production of other oilseeds was lower.  Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made  up for lower production in the United States, he said.  Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S.  stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.  The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes,  about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.  Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased  13.1 mln tonnes.  \"During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1  mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world  surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially  high prices caused by the U.S. loan program.\"  \"Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds  prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long  as the U.S. soybean surplus continues.  For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a  range tied to the U.S. loan program.  \"Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply  overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the  U.S. loan rate.\"  The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially  high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and  Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.

      "1  EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND\t LONDON, April 3 -\t The European Commission's decision to  release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention  feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate  relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.  Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage,  pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the  market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes  were granted.  The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to  satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for  supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.  The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong  representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.  There has been growing concern that rising internal prices,  triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in  interior markets.  The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the  April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month.  The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and  June.  News of the release produced an early downward reaction in  local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved  early two stg losses while others were unchanged.  Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln  tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the  free market. However, some traders believe these figures are  overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the  bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off  the market in futures stores.  A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been  sold for export or to the home market since the season started  July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59  mln tonnes.  Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln  tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.  This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all  early expectations and has created the present nervous  situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market  supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in  August.  The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total  barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new  record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes  achieved in the 1984/85 season.  Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and  barley around 4.50 mln tonnes.  The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln  tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28  mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders  said.  Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British  grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln  tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares  with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.  The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay  buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies  become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed  compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said.  Reuter \n",

      "-1  INDUSTRIAL ACTION ENDS AT SOUTH AFRICAN MINE\t JOHANNESBURG, April 2 -\t About 8,000 black miners returned  to work after a week-long industrial action at South Africa's  largest gold mine, mine owner Anglo American Corp of South  Africa Ltd & lt;ANGL.J > said.  A spokesman for the mining house said the action started on  Wednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a go-slow  at One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division of  Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd & lt;FSCN.J > .  The action later escalated into an underground sit-in at  the mine over the weekend, prompting management to close the  affected shaft because of what the company described as \"the  cre ation of unsafe working conditions.\"  Anglo American spokesman John Kingsley-Jones said the  company held talks with the National Union of Mineworkers  (NUM), South Africa's biggest trade union which claims a  membership of 360,000 black workers, but failed to establish  the cause of worker dissatisfaction. He acknowledged that the  mine suffered a loss of production, but declined to give  estimates.  Free State Consolidated last year produced 104 tonnes of  gold from 28 underground shafts.  The NUM was not immediately available for comment on the  action. But a spokesman for the union earlier told the South  African Press Association that miners had been locked out of  the mine at the weekend after staging a strike in protest  against being ordered to carry bags containing explosives as  well as food for white miners.

      "1  U.S. SENATOR TO PROPOSE 0/92 FOR 1987 CROPS\t WASHINGTON, March 4 -\t Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he  intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers  of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92  pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they  planted.  Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that  applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was  supported by the Reagan administration and would save  approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn  payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.  The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the  Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of  Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House  Agriculture Committee is approved by that body.  Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.  Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency  payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not  to plant under the decoupling scheme.  If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market  prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished  deficiency payments.  Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,  said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as  possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter  further before deciding how he would vote on it.

      "-1  PHELPS DODGE & lt;PD > SETS SIGHTS ON ACQUISITION\t NEW YORK, June 2 -\t Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert  Durham said the company is prepared to make another large  non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the  near future.  In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company was  examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.  He declined to name the companies but said a deal could  occur as soon as the second half of 1987.    Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in  the U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals  Co, a maker of c arbon black which is used in rubber and tires  among other products.  The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and  eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper  operations.  Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs  to buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about  100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.    Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different  economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good  management, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly  deal, he added.  \"We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or  about a perfume company,\" he said. \"We want a good basic  industrial company that will fit into our management  structure,\" Durham said.    During the interview, Durham and other executives also said  continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to  higher prices for the metal.  \"In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price  (for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new  projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,  will continue to grow modestly,\" said executive vice president  Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of  producing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50  cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and  corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.  Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now  compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts  said.  Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been  for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.  He declined to project results for the second quarter or  year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in  copper prices in the last month will help results.  Durham said last month that the second quarter should match  the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln  dlrs or 49 cts a share.  First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,  reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased  copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also  acquired last year.  Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75  dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.  Reuter \n",

      "1  U.S. DRAFTS SANCTIONS IN ARGENTINA SOY CASE\t WASHINGTON, Oct 19 -\t The U.S. is drafting options including  possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over  the differential between soybean and product  taxes which  Buenos Aires levies on exports.  The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure  of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed  by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.  officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential  export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in  competition with the U.S.  \"Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict  (Argentine) access to our market,\" said one U.S. source.    The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to  end the differential.  But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88  year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.  Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture  minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille  on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not  narrow the differential further for 1987/88.  As a result of the impasse , the U.S. is considering  restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef  and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.  A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan  administration soon, they said.  Reuter \n",

Silver prices in March gained some 15 pct in dlr terms due  to a weak dollar and silver is felt to be fairly cheap relative  to gold, Montagu said in its monthly silver newsletter. In  March the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67.  The supply/demand position has improved in the past year,  and despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver is  modest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added.  The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely to  continue in the short term.  A period of consolidation might be necessary before prices  attempted to move significantly higher,it said, but so long as  the dollar remains under pressure then the outlook for silver  was positive.  However silver was less likely to continue to outpace the  other metals by such a margin, Montagu said.  REUTER \n",

      "1  MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE\t WASHINGTON, March 4 -\t Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill  its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement  depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official  told Reuters.  \"How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement  if the United States does not want to offer us grain at  competitive prices?\" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade  representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.  \"We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the  United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive  prices,\" he said in an interview.  Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the  agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at  prevailing market prices.  \"We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.  We do not consider we are at fault,\" Melnikov said.  Article I in the agreement states that \"purchases/sales of  commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market  price prevailing for these products at the time of  purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms.\"  \"The United States should supply to the Soviet Union  definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the  United States ready to supply this?\" he said.  The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has  been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he  confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices  remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.  Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.  \"If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,  then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the  United States to decide how these competitive prices will be  offered,\" he said.  Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets  was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.  He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,  U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.  Reuter \n",

      "-1  CANADA TO MONITOR STEEL IMPORTS, EXPORTS\t OTTAWA, April 8 -\t Canada plans to monitor steel shipments  flowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease  concerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steel  exports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.  \"To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market,  the government is taking further action to ensure we have more  accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not  used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,\"  Carney said.  Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to  exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were  considering establishing a joint commission to study the  growing steel problem.  Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an  amendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up the  monitoring program.  Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct  cent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the  level just two years ago, Canadian t rade officials said.  The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of  growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from  several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic  steel industry.  Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the  American market be limited to 2.4 pct.  Reuter \n",

At least two fixtures were reported on Soviet account to  lift EC grain, with a 22,000 tonner booked from Tilbury for a  voyage via lower Baltic Sea and redelivery passing Skaw at  4,000 dlrs daily and a 27,000 tonner from Ceuta for a voyage  via the U.K. And redelivery Skaw-Cape Passero at 4,500 dlrs  daily.  The Soviets also secured a 34,000 tonner from Gibraltar for  a trans-Atlantic round trip at 4,500 dlrs daily and a 61,000  tonner for similar business at 6,750 dlrs daily.  Brokers said several other fixtures were also thought to be  connected with Soviet grain, including a 69,000 tonner from  Taranto for five to seven months at 6,500 dlrs daily. Similar  fixing was reported yesterday at 6,000 dlrs.  Other timecharter fixing included a 14,000 tonner from  Indonesia to the U.S. Gulf at 2,800 dlrs daily and a combined  carrier of 75,000 tonnes dw from the U.S. Gulf to Italy at  9,000 dlrs daily.

Grain fixing was much quieter out of the U.S. Gulf, with no  fresh business seen on the significant routes to the Continent  or Japan, although tonnage was secured for at least five small  corn cargoes from the Gulf to Jamaica at between 21 and 25  dlrs. Wheat from the River Plate and Buenos Aires to Sri Lanka  received 26 dlrs.  Market talk suggested 11 dlrs had been paid for grain from  the U.S. North Pacific to Japan but no confirmation was  available.  Fairly active grain fixing emerged out of the Continent,  however, with maize covered from Nantes to Egypt at 15 dlrs,  and bagged flour from Greece to China at 27 dlrs.  Barley cargoes were arranged from Immingham to the Red Sea  at 17.25 dlrs and from Foynes to Jeddah at 17.25 dlrs.  Reuter \n",

They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet  imports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought  one mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reagan  administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets  U.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.  In its supply-demand report, the USDA raised its estimate  for 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln.  \"That was business already done, for all practical  purposes,\" said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson,  reflecting similar statements made by other analysts.
